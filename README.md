# My-Mini Projects
Things that I did during my college days...

#1 MicroStrip Patch Antenna Design Calculator

  Language: JAVA

  A GUI to perform the calculation of various parameters of a microstrip patch antenna design. Made it so that I can avoid doing those long calculations.

#2 Certificate Generator for Workshops & events

  Tool: MATLAB

  A piece of code in MATLAB, that helps us to generate e-certificates for events/workshops, provided the participants' names and other customisable details in a           spreadsheet(.xls format).
